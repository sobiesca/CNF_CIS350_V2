## 1 Abstract

The time people spend searching through articles trying to find information on a specific type of technology is a huge number. Finding relevant information can be a hassle for everyone. Due to this there is a need for sifting through web articles that don't have information relevant to the technology you need more information about. This is the main idea behind our Cyber Security News Filtering Application.

## 2 Introduction

Our Cybersecurity News Filtering App is going to be able to allow users to make a search and apply filters to get the most accurate data on that specific technology. After applying the filters you want it will then search a few notable sources to get up to date and relative information on a specific product. This idea will hopefully save people copious amounts of time and allow them to make more informed decisions when researching technologies.
