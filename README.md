## 1 Abstract

The time people spend searching through articles trying to find information on a specific type of technology is a huge number. Finding relevant information can be a hassle for everyone. Due to this there is a need for sifting through web articles that don't have information relevant to the technology you need more information about. This is the main idea behind our Cyber Security News Filtering Application.

## 2 Introduction

Our Cybersecurity News Filtering App is going to be able to allow users to make a search and apply filters to get the most accurate data on that specific technology. After applying the filters you want it will then search a few notable sources to get up to date and relative information on a specific product. This idea will hopefully save people copious amounts of time and allow them to make more informed decisions when researching technologies.

## 4 User Guide/Implementation

## 4.1 Starting the News Filter
Once the user has installed the codebase with all dependencies, the user can run the application by either pressing the start button in VSCode or running the command " " in the terminal. Then the user will see the blank filter page ready to search for all articles or filtered articles.

## 5 Future Scope

There are a multitude of paths that development of this app can take. Some of the big developments that could be implemented in the future are automatic updates through a script, improved dashboard that will display article headers with a short excerpt from the new article and the ability to store preferences in a data base that is tied to a user account.

## 6 Conclusion
Overall this application has a lot of future potential as there is nothing similar to its concept on the market currently. It could be turned into a powerful information tool and even a data analytic tool to monitor cyber security trends if future development is pursued. Even currently it is an interesting tool with its ability to filter for key words from a pre-selected list of new sites.
